==================
Leaflet AreaSelect
==================

AreaSelect is a leaflet plugin for letting users select a square area (bounding box), 
using a resizable centered box on top of the map.

Another similar plugin is `leaflet-locationfilter <https://github.com/kajic/leaflet-locationfilter/>`_, 
which solves the same problem but provides a rectangle that is movable and not fixed to the center, 
but doesn't support keeping the aspect ratio. 


Example Code
============

.. code-block:: javascript

    // Add it to the map
    var areaSelect = L.areaSelect({width:200, height:300, minWidth:40, minHeight:40, minHorizontalSpacing:40, minVerticalSpacing:100});
    areaSelect.addTo(map);
    
    // Read the bouding box
    var bounds = areaSelect.getBounds();
    
    // Get a callback when the bounds change
    areaSelect.on("change", function() {
        console.log("Bounds:", this.getBounds());
    });
    
    // Set the dimensions of the box
    areaSelect.setDimensions({width: 500, height: 500})

    // And to remove it do:
    //areaSelect.remove();

**You can also make it keep the aspect ratio:**

.. code-block:: javascript

    var areaSelect = L.areaSelect({width:200, height:300, keepAspectRatio:true});
    
**If you need the coordinates for all four corners of the bounding box:**

.. code-block:: javascript

    var bboxCoordinates = areaSelect.getBBoxCoordinates();
